In the conclusion as the future plans to better an algorithm you can write:
Playing with hyperparameters of the Replay buffer:
Earlier works investigating replay buffers have often focused on individual hyperparameters, such as the capacity of the replay buffer (Zhang and Sutton, 2017), which has typically been preserved since the seminal work in this field of Mnih et al. (2013; 2015). We begin by identifying that several such hyperparameters, such as buffer capacity and rate of data throughput, are interlinked in the manner that they affect experience replay, modifying both the amount of data available to an agent and the typical age of that data.
